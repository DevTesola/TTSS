# IPFS Image Loading Fix

This document outlines the issues and solutions for improving IPFS image loading in the TESOLA platform, particularly in the staking components.

## Problem Summary

The staking dashboard and NFT gallery components experience several issues with IPFS image loading:

1. Inconsistent gateway URL formatting (`/ipfs` vs `/ipfs/`)
2. Excessive and inefficient cache busting
3. Duplicate and scattered staking component detection logic
4. Problems with CID extraction from different URL formats
5. Inconsistent handling between different components
6. Unpredictable image loading failures and flickering

## Solution Overview

The fixed version of `mediaUtils.js` addresses these issues through several key improvements:

1. **Consistent Gateway URL Formatting**: Ensures all gateway URLs end with `/ipfs/` for consistency
2. **Centralized Staking Component Detection**: Added a single helper function to detect staking-related components
3. **Improved CID Extraction**: Enhanced logic for extracting CIDs from different URL formats
4. **Optimized Cache Management**: Different cache TTLs for staking vs. normal content
5. **Efficient Cache Busting**: More efficient cache busting mechanism using timestamp precision
6. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better fallbacks and error recovery mechanisms
7. **Structured URL Processing**: Clear prioritization of URL types (IPFS, local, remote)

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. **Gateway URL Formatting**
   - Fixed `formatGatewayUrl` to ensure consistent `/ipfs/` format with trailing slash
   - Properly handles all gateway URL patterns

2. **Staking Component Detection**
   - Created `isStakingComponent` helper function
   - Centralized detection logic that was previously scattered

3. **CID Extraction**
   - Improved extraction from various URL formats
   - Better handling of paths following the CID

4. **Cache Management**
   - Different TTLs for staking (5 minutes) vs normal content (24 hours)
   - Enhanced LRU cache with better key generation

5. **Image URL Processing**
   - Refactored `processImageUrl` with clear prioritization
   - Special handling for staking components

6. **Fallback and Error Handling**
   - Added gateway fallback mechanisms
   - Better error recovery in `preloadImage`

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Automatic Update

Run the update script:

```bash
node ./scripts/update-media-utils.js
```

This script will:
1. Create a backup of the original file (if not exists)
2. Replace the original with the fixed version
3. Display a summary of changes and testing instructions

### Option 2: Manual Update

If you prefer to manually apply the changes:

1. Review the differences between `utils/mediaUtils.js` and `utils/mediaUtils.fixed.js`
2. Copy the fixed version to replace the original:
   ```bash
   cp utils/mediaUtils.fixed.js utils/mediaUtils.js
   ```

### Reverting Changes

If you need to revert to the original version:

```bash
node ./scripts/restore-media-utils.js
```

## Testing the Fix

Test the fix by:

1. Running the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigating to the staking page to verify images load correctly
3. Checking NFT galleries for proper image loading
4. Verifying other pages that use IPFS images also work correctly
5. Inspecting browser console for any errors

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Features

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Using a modified LRU cache with expiration
   - Different cache durations based on content type
   - More efficient cache key generation

2. **URL Processing Pipeline**
   - Clear precedence: IPFS URLs → Local paths → Regular URLs
   - Special treatment for staking components

3. **Cache Busting**
   - Configurable precision (second/minute/hour/day)
   - More efficient and less resource-intensive

4. **Gateway Handling**
   - Consistent formatting across all gateways
   - Fallback mechanism for failed gateways

## Conclusion

This fix significantly improves the reliability and performance of IPFS image loading throughout the application, with special attention to the staking components that were experiencing the most issues. The changes maintain compatibility with existing components while addressing the underlying problems in the URL processing logic.
